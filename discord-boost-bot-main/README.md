# discord-boost-bot
Free Working Boost-Bot for discord. I bought a outdated boost-bot and fixed it.

Download the zip. Export it. Open it. Run BotSettings.json with a scripting programm (for example: Notepad++) and paste in the informations!
You need to download python. Then open Powershell and type in "pip install requests","pip install pycord","pip install discord" and "pip install discord.ext"
